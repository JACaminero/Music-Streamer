# Spotify-Assistant

This is a little fun project that i started out of boredom, 
the idea is to add some interesting functionality to the music streaming app Spotify 
by using some developer services and APIs offered by the Spotify Technologies company 
in their web page.

Because the spotify api currently only works in front-end js (not Node.JS),
for this project i'll be using pure javascript, html and css.

The first thing i plan on doing is a little script that will analize the play history 
of a user once every week and add the one track that was played the most in that week
to a playlist of his liking.
